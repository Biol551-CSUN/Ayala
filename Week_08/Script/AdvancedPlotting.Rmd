## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}

### LOAD LIBRARIES###

  geom_jitter(width = 0.2) # jitter type of plot
plot2
```

```{r}

plot1/plot2 + # stacked vertically

```

```{r}
### using ggrepel ###
#View(mtcars)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, # weight for the car
                   y = mpg, # miels per gallon
                   label = rownames(mtcars))) + # label is the row names
  geom_text() + # creates a text label

  geom_point(color = 'navy')

```
```{r}
### do you believe in magick?? ###

penguin<-image_read("https://pngimg.com/uploads/penguin/pinguin_PNG9.png") # read in image
penguin # image named as penguin
# To put penguin on a plot you first need to save your plot as an image.
penguins %>%
ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, # x axis
            y = bill_depth_mm,# y axis
            color = species)) + # color coded species
  geom_point() # points are color coded
ggsave(here("Week_08","Output","penguinplot.png"))
```

```{r}
# read in the plot as a magick image and make a composite plot
penplot<-image_read(here("Week_08","Output","penguinplot.png"))
out <- image_composite(penplot, penguin, offset = "+70+30")
out

# Read in a penguin gif
pengif<-image_read("https://media3.giphy.com/media/H4uE6w9G1uK4M/giphy.gif")
outgif <- image_composite(penplot, pengif, gravity = "center")
animation <- image_animate(outgif, fps = 10, optimize = TRUE)
animation
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
